# Blue Bank Loan Analysis Using Python and Tableau

## Introduction

Blue Bank is a prominent financial institution in the USA with a busy loan department facing staffing challenges. The lack of comprehensive reporting on borrower risk has prompted the need for an efficient analysis to enhance decision-making processes. This project aims to address these challenges through data extraction, cleaning, and analysis using Python and Tableau.

## Project Overview

Blue Bank's loan department lacks detailed insights into borrower risk profiles, making it challenging to optimize lending strategies. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Utilized the Spyder IDE in Python to extract data from a JSON file.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Employed Python to clean and preprocess the data, creating new columns to enrich the dataset.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Utilized Tableau to perform an in-depth analysis of the loan data, identifying patterns and assessing borrower risk.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Generated visualizations in Tableau to provide clear and intuitive insights into the loan portfolio.

5. **Output:**
   - Saved the cleaned data and analysis results for reference and future use.
